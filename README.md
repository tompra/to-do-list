# To-do-list

## Project description
To build a small web application with HTML, CSS, Javascript and the jQuery library. User should be able to view a list of pokemons and see more details when clicking on a pokemon.

### What would I improve in the project?
I would add the date and time of every to-do point made. Try to add this event to google calendar (if possible).

## Technical Requirements
The user can add a new item to a list of items.
The user can cross out an item from the list of items.
The user can delete an item from the list of items.
The user can change the order of items in the list. 
Javascript must be formatted within the ESLint rules, via Prettier and manually formatted.
